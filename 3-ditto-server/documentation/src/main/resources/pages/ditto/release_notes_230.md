Compared to the latest release [2.2.0](release_notes_220.html), the following most notable changes, new features and
bugfixes were added.


### New features

#### [HTTP API for "live" commands](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/106)

Ditto's ["live" channel](protocol-twinlive.html#live) is now also available for commands invoked via HTTP API.  
See also the [blogpost covering that topic](2021-12-20-http-live-channel.html).

To qualify a command (e.g. "modify thing" or "retrieve feature property") as a "live" command, the header or 
query parameter `channel=live` has to be specified.

Live commands bypass the twin and go directly to the devices.  
However, an existing twin is still required for policy enforcement.


#### [Smart channel strategy for live/twin read access](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/issues/1228)

Ditto adds support for selecting the "twin" or the "live" channel for thing query commands based on an 
[RQL condition](basic-rql.html) of a newly added parameter 
[live channel condition](basic-conditional-requests.html#live-channel-condition).  
See also the [blogpost covering that topic](2021-12-22-live-channel-condition.html).

In addition, a new [payload mapper](connectivity-mapping.html#updatetwinwithliveresponse-mapper) automatically updating 
the twin based on received live data from devices was added.

#### [Configurable allowing creation of entities based on namespace and authenticated subjects](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/pull/1251)

This added feature allows configuring restrictions, which [authenticated subjects](basic-auth.html#authenticated-subjects)
may create new entities (things / policies) in which namespaces.

#### [Allow using `*` as a placeholder for the feature id in selected fields](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto/pull/1277)

When selecting for certain [`fields` of a thing](httpapi-concepts.html#field-selector-with-wildcard) or when using 
[signal enrichment (extraFields)](basic-enrichment.html) in order to add more (unchanged) data from a twin to e.g. events 
the wildcard `*` can now be used in order to select all features of a thing without the need to know their feature names.
