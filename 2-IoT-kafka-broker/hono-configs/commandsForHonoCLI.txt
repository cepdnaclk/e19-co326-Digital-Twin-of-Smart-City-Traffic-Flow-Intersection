Check the Hono CLI help:

bash
Copy code
./bin/hono-cli --help
2. Connecting to a Hono Server
Before you can use the hono-cli, you need to know the connection details of your Hono server (such as the hostname and port).

bash
Copy code
./bin/hono-cli devices list --tenant <tenant ID>
Delete a Device:

4. Tenant Management
Register a Tenant:

bash
Copy code
./bin/hono-cli telemetry send --tenant <tenant ID> --device <device ID> --payload "Hello, Hono!"

6. Configuration and Advanced Usage
You can customize your hono-cli usage further by using various options and flags. For detailed usage, refer to the help command:

bash
Copy code
./bin/hono-cli <command> --help
For example, to get help on the devices create command:

bash
Copy code
./bin/hono-cli devices create --help
