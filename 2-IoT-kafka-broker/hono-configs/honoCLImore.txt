In Eclipse Hono, tenants and devices are fundamental concepts that help manage and organize IoT devices and their interactions within the platform. Here's a brief explanation of each:

### Tenants

**Tenants** in Eclipse Hono represent distinct logical units or domains that can isolate data and resources within the platform. Each tenant typically corresponds to a different organization, customer, or application. Tenants are used to segregate the data and devices managed by different entities, ensuring that each tenant's data remains isolated and secure.

- **Purpose**: Tenants help in multi-tenancy scenarios where multiple clients or applications share the same Hono instance but require isolation for data and device management.
- **Configuration**: Each tenant can have its own configuration settings, such as security credentials, quotas, and specific behaviors for the devices registered under it.

### Devices

**Devices** in Eclipse Hono are the individual IoT devices that connect to the platform. Each device is identified uniquely within the context of its tenant.

- **Identification**: Devices are uniquely identified by their device identifiers (IDs) within a tenant. The combination of tenant ID and device ID uniquely identifies a device within the Hono platform.
- **Registration**: Devices need to be registered in the Hono platform before they can interact with it. Registration involves providing metadata and configuration settings for the device, such as its authentication credentials and any specific configuration parameters.
- **Interaction**: Devices send telemetry data, receive commands, and can be managed remotely through the Hono platform. The platform facilitates communication between the devices and the backend services or applications.

### Using Hono CLI for Tenants and Devices

The Hono CLI (Command Line Interface) provides commands to manage tenants and devices within the Hono platform. Here are some common tasks you can perform with the Hono CLI:

#### Managing Tenants

1. **List Tenants**: Display the list of tenants.
   ```bash
   hono tenants list
   ```

2. **Create a Tenant**: Create a new tenant with specific configurations.
   ```bash
   hono tenants create <tenant-id> --setting key=value
   ```

3. **Get Tenant Details**: Retrieve details of a specific tenant.
   ```bash
   hono tenants get <tenant-id>
   ```

4. **Delete a Tenant**: Delete an existing tenant.
   ```bash
   hono tenants delete <tenant-id>
   ```

#### Managing Devices

1. **List Devices**: List all devices for a specific tenant.
   ```bash
   hono devices list <tenant-id>
   ```

2. **Register a Device**: Register a new device under a specific tenant.
   ```bash
   hono devices create <tenant-id> <device-id> --setting key=value
   ```

3. **Get Device Details**: Retrieve details of a specific device.
   ```bash
   hono devices get <tenant-id> <device-id>
   ```

4. **Delete a Device**: Delete an existing device.
   ```bash
   hono devices delete <tenant-id> <device-id>
   ```

5. **Update Device**: Update the configuration of an existing device.
   ```bash
   hono devices update <tenant-id> <device-id> --setting key=value
   ```

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a Tenant**:
   ```bash
   hono tenants create my-tenant
   ```

2. **Register a Device**:
   ```bash
   hono devices create my-tenant my-device --setting auth-id=my-auth-id --setting password=my-password
   ```

3. **List Devices**:
   ```bash
   hono devices list my-tenant
   ```

4. **Get Device Details**:
   ```bash
   hono devices get my-tenant my-device
   ```

This structure allows you to efficiently manage IoT devices and ensure they are securely and effectively integrated within the Hono platform.
